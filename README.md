# Building
This project comes with a Makefile.

 - Just use

 		make run

to run all the steps in line.

Alternatively, 
 - Use

		make preprocess

to run just the *Data Pre-processing* step

 - Use

		make build-model

to only *build the model* for prediction, provided the training dataset is available (from the preprocessing step)
